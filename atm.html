			<p><h1 id="sub">The ATM Program</h1>
			<p>Bancroft's ATM program is incredible. It is, by far, one of the greatest experiences I've had in my life. 
				The 3-year computer program helps teach technological skills such as typing, coding, filming, etc. 
				Additionally, the ATM program also teaches other skills such as presenting to large groups, floorplanning, 
				and graphic design. The ATM program is the thing that taught me how to code this website from scratch!
				The phenomenal ATM program has taught me tons of things over the course of 3 years and I am incredibly happy 
				that I was chosen to be in it.
