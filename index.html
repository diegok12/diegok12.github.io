		<p>Hi! My name is Diego! I'm an eighth grader at Bancroft Middle School in Long Beach, 
			California. I love to read in my free time and I love math! English and
			math are tied for my favorite subjects in school. In addition, I love playing
			sports! I've played baseball and soccer for 6 years and have swam since the age of 6. 
			I've played piano for 6 years, clarinet for 2 years and have liked to sing since the 
			age of 10.

			hiking, etc. My family consists of my 2 parents and my 2 younger brothers. My mom, Mirna,
