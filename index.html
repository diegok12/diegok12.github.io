		<h1 id="sub">About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi! My name is Diego! I'm an eighth grader at Bancroft Middle School in Long Beach, 
			California. I love to read in my free time and I love math!
			English and math are tied for my favorite subjects in school. In addition, I love playing
			sports! I've played baseball and soccer for 6 years and have swam since the age of 6.
			I've played piano for 6 years, clarinet for 2 years and have liked to sing since the 
			age of 10.</p>
		
		
		<h1 id="sub">Family</h1>
		<p>My family is incredible. We do all sorts of things together--going to movies, the beach, 
			hiking, etc. My family consists of my 2 parents and my 2 younger brothers. My mom, Mirna, 
			is an attorney at Morgan Lewis Law Firm. My dad, a computer engineer, works for United Health 
			Care. My youngest brother, David, is 7 years old and is in the 2nd grade at 
			Mark Twain Elementary School. My other brother, Victor, is 11 and is in the 6th grade at 
			Bancroft Middle School. </p>
